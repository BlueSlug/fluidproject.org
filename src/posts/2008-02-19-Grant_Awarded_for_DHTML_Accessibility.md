Grant Awarded for DHTML Accessibility {.fluid-web-emphasized-text}
-------------------------------------

Posted by Colin Clark on 2008-02-19

The Adaptive Technology Resource Centre at the University of Toronto has
received a grant from the Mozilla Foundation to promote DHTML
accessibility and the adoption of ARIA (the W3C Web Accessibility
Initiative's Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification).

The Fluid project will participate in this work, which will involve
evangelism, mentoring, community-building, and technical leadership. One
of the key contributions will be to work with the jQuery community to
implement ARIA support in this popular toolkit.
