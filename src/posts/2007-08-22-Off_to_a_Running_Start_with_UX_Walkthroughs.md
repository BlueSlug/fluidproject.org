Off to a Running Start with UX Walkthroughs {.fluid-web-emphasized-text}
-------------------------------------------

Posted by Fluid Project on 2007-08-22

The Fluid team is using UX (user experience) walkthroughs of target
applications to identify "pain points" encountered by users.

As the primary goal of Fluid is to improve the user’s experience, we
plan to apply recognized and formally constituted methods to identify
problems and prioritize improvements. With this in mind, at the very
beginning of the project, we started defining and documenting a
step-by-step UX walkthrough process – a combination of usability and
accessibility heuristic evaluations with cognitive walkthroughs – and
are now putting this into practice with Sakai and uPortal as our first
subjects.

We welcome volunteers! If you are interested in helping, you can:

- Join the Sakai, Moodle, or uPortal [working
    groups](http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/UX+Walkthrough+Working+Groups)
    and help out with the walkthroughs themselves.
- Improve the [UX Walkthrough
    area](http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/User+Experience+Walkthroughs)
    of our wiki as it is in need of organization and consolidation. If
    you’ve got time for some quick editing and re-organization, please
    feel free! \
- Share your accessibility expertise and advice with the [working
    groups](http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/UX+Walkthrough+Working+Groups).

For more information on UX Walkthroughs, please see the [UX Walkthrough
area](http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/User+Experience+Walkthroughs)
