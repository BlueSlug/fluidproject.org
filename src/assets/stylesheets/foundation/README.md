# About This Build of Foundation

*Version*: 6.3.1

  * Grid max-width was set to 76rem
* All files removed from the extracted ZIP file except *foundation.css*
* The Normalize.css file included by default in *foundation.css* was removed because Infusion includes a copy of its own.
* Foundation.css had been edited in order to suit needs of Fluidproject.org
