### Pull Requests

After a Pull Request (PR) has been submitted, one or more members of the community will review the contribution. This
typically results in a back and forth conversation and modifications to the PR. Merging into the project repo is a
manual process and requires at least one [Maintainer](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Fluid+Maintainers) to
sign off on the PR and merge it into the project repo. You may wish to ping a Maintainer on the
[#fluid-work](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/IRC+Channel) IRC channel,
[fluid-work](https://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/mailman/listinfo/fluid-work) mailing list, and/or on the PR itself.
